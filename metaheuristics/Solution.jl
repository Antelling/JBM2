"""Solution API

The solution module contains all problem methods under the Problem
submodule.

A solution is tightly coupled with a problem, and exposes the following
methods:

Solution(bitarray, problem)::Solution - construct a solution object for the passed
problem, and score it for the passed bitarray

Solution.score::Int - objective function value of the solution

cond_flip_bit!(Solution, index)::Bool - check if flipping the bit in the solution at
index will improve the objective value in an efficient manner. If it will,
mutate the passed solution to the new improved version, and return True. It
it will not, do nothing and return False.

flip_bit!(Solution, index) - mutate the solution in place
